# Concierge

This is a fork of the Support-Manager project found here: liba001.github.io/Support-Manager/.

The aim of this project is to personalize the support process, by moving the process to private chat, before broadcasting to available support staff.

Support staff will then be able to work the queue, and engage with customers in public chat.
